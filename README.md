# Project Description

This project focuses on the prediction of students' academic performance using a public dataset acquired from the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Academics+Performance), which was originally presented in [1].

The dataset has been converted to a csv file and prediction is done using a standard Python-based toolkit, rather than WEKA, which is used in the original paper.

The features, along with brief descriptions, are extracted from [1] in the following image:
