## Description

This project focuses on the prediction of students' academic performance using publically available datasets acquired from the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Academics+Performance) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data), which were originally presented in [1] and [2], respectively.

Prediction is done using a standard Python-based toolkit, rather than WEKA, which is used in the original paper.

Utilized packages:
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* seabornplot
* jupyter notebooks
